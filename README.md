# PhysicsFinal2020
Our codebase for the AP Physics Final Project. We simulate gas particles beginning at a uniform kinetic energy to confirm that they end with a Boltzmann Distribution

XXXXXX is the number of particles, ZZ is the number of trials done, and YYYY is the number of time-steps computed. The file contains the KE of each of the particles in a Mathematica-ready array for each of the ZZ trials.
